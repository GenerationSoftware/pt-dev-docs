## Delegation Sweepstakes

Any depositor in PoolTogether can delegate their chance to win to another address while maintaining custody of the deposit. Read more about delegation [in the Cabana docs](https://docs.cabana.fi/cabana-app/delegation).

## NFT Prize Sweepstakes

You can gift any prizes a deposit wins to a random holder of a unique NFT collection with no entry required! Create and set a custom [prize hook](/protocol/guides/customize/prize-hooks) that automatically awards prizes to a random holder using that draw's random number. Check out the example code [here](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-builder-code-examples/tree/main/src/prize-hooks/examples/prize-to-nft-holder#hook-to-award-prizes-to-a-random-nft-holder).

## TWAB Rewards

Rewards can be airdropped to depositors in any prize vault proportion to their Time Weighted Average Balance (TWAB). Set up a rewards program by using the [Cabana Rewards Builder](https://rewards.cabana.fi/). Drops can even be retroactive!
