## What is a Prize Vault?

Deploying a new prize vault is the primary way in which to extend PoolTogether. A prize vault uses a yield source to take in deposits and generate yield which is then liquidated for prize tokens and contributed to the prize pool. Depositors are then eligible to win prizes which are automatically sent to them each draw.

## Prize Vault Factory

Deploying a new prize vault is made easy using the [Cabana Factory](https://factory.cabana.fi/)! Simply plug in a compatible ERC4626 yield source and get your prize vault running in minutes.

## Looking for Something Custom?

Some integrations may require a custom implementation to work with the prize pool. Learn [how to create a custom prize vault](/protocol/guides/customize/custom-prize-vault) that still has access to the full PoolTogether prize pool!
