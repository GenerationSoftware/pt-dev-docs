## What are bots?

Bots are automated scripts that anyone can create and run to keep the core PoolTogether systems operational while earning a profit. There are three core operations that bots can run:

1. [Liquidating Yield](./liquidating-yield)
2. [Claiming Prizes](./claiming-prizes)
3. [Generating RNG for the Draws](./completing-draw-auctions)

## Open Source Bots

Anyone can create a new bot and compete against others to perform these operations efficiently. If you'd like to run your own bot, check out some of the open source bot code to get started!
