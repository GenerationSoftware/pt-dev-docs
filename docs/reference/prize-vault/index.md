The PoolTogether Prize Vault Factory makes it easy to deploy new prize-linked vaults using compatible ERC4626 yield vaults. The prize vaults are the entry point for new users in PoolTogether; users deposit into a prize vault and automatically start winning prizes just by holding the vault share token.
